// ðŸŒŸ Exercise 1 : Find The Sum
// Instructions
// Create a one line function (ie. an arrow function) that receives two numbers as parameters and 
// returns the sum. 
const findSum = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;

findSum(4,5)

// ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2 : Kg And Grams
// Instructions
// Create a function that receives a weight in kilograms and returns it in grams. (Hint: 1 kg is 1000gr)

// First, use function declaration and invoke it.
// Then, use function expression and invoke it.
// Write in a one line comment, the difference between function declaration and function expression.
// Finally, use a one line arrow function and invoke it.

// Function declaration
function convertToGrams(kg) {
return kg * 1000;
}

// Invoking function declaration
console.log(convertToGrams(2)); // Output: 2000

// Function expression
const convertToGramsExpr = function(kg) {
return kg * 1000;
}

// Invoking function expression
console.log(convertToGramsExpr(2)); // Output: 2000

// One line arrow function
const convertToGramsArrow = kg => kg * 1000;

// Invoking one line arrow function
console.log(convertToGramsArrow(2)); // Output: 2000



// we have implemented the convertToGrams() function in three different ways:

// Function declaration: This is a traditional way to define a function. We define the function using the 
// function keyword followed by the function name and parameters. In this case, the function takes a weight 
// in kilograms and returns the weight in grams.
// Function expression: This is another way to define a function, where we assign a function to a variable. 
// In this case, we define the function using the function keyword followed by the parameters and return 
// statement, and then assign it to the convertToGramsExpr variable.
// One line arrow function: This is a shorter and more concise way to define a function using the arrow (=>) 
// syntax. In this case, we define the function using a single line of code that takes the weight in 
// kilograms as the parameter and returns the weight in grams by multiplying it by 1000.
// The main difference between function declaration and function expression is that function declarations 
// are hoisted (meaning they can be called before they are declared), while function expressions are not. 
// This means that if you try to call a function expression before it is declared, you will get an error. 
// Additionally, function expressions can be assigned to variables, while function declarations cannot.



// ðŸŒŸ Exercise 3 : Fortune Teller
// Instructions
// Create a self invoking function that takes 4 arguments: number of children, partnerâ€™s name, 
// geographic location, job title.
// The function should display in the DOM a sentence like "You will be a <job title> in 
//   <geographic location>, and married to <partner's name> with <number of children> kids." 


(function(numChildren, partnerName, geoLocation, jobTitle) {
const fortune = `You will be a ${jobTitle} in ${geoLocation}, and married to ${partnerName} with ${numChildren} kids.`;
document.getElementById("fortune").innerHTML = fortune;
})

(2, "John", "New York", "Web Developer");



//We have created a self-invoking function that takes in 4 arguments: 
//numChildren, partnerName, geoLocation, and jobTitle. We have also defined a string variable fortune that 
//concatenates these arguments in a sentence.

//To display this sentence in the DOM, we have used the innerHTML property of the 
//document.getElementById("fortune") element, which inserts the value of the fortune variable into the 
//HTML page.

//Finally, we have called the self-invoking function and passed in some sample values for the arguments 
//(2, "John", "New York", and "Web Developer") to test the function and display the fortune message in the 
//DOM.

//Note that this function is self-invoking, which means it automatically executes as soon as it is defined, 
//without needing to be called separately. This can be useful for creating one-time or initialization 
//tasks in your code.




// ðŸŒŸ Exercise 4 : Welcome
// Instructions
// John has just signed in to your website and you want to welcome him.

// Create a Bootstrap Navbar in your HTML file.
// In your js file, create a self invoking funtion that takes 1 argument: the name of the user that just signed in.
// The function should add a div in the nabvar, displaying the name of the user and his profile picture. 





(function(name) {
const userProfile = document.getElementById("user-profile");
userProfile.innerHTML = `
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/50" alt="Profile picture">
  <span class="ml-2">Welcome, ${name}!</span>
`;
})("John");



// Go to the Bootstrap website at https://getbootstrap.com/

// we have created a self-invoking function that takes in the name of the user that just signed in as 
// an argument. We have also defined a variable userProfile that refers to the div element with the id of 
// user-profile.

// To display the user's name and profile picture in the navbar, we have used the innerHTML property of 
// the userProfile element to set its contents to an HTML string that contains an image and a welcome 
// message with the user's name.




// ðŸŒŸ Exercise 5 : Juice Bar
// Instructions
// You will use nested functions, to open a new juice bar.

// Part I:
// The outer function named makeJuice receives 1 argument: the size of the beverage the client wants - small, 
// medium or large.

// The inner function named addIngredients receives 3 ingredients, and displays on the DOM a sentence like 
// The client wants a <size drink> juice, containing <first ingredient>, <second ingredient>, 
//   <third ingredient>".

// Invoke the inner function ONCE inside the outer function. Then invoke the outer function in the global 
// scope.


// Part II:
// In the makeJuice function, create an empty array named ingredients.

// The addIngredients function should now receive 3 ingredients, and push them into the ingredients array.

// Create a new inner function named displayJuice that displays on the DOM a sentence like The client 
// wants a <size drink> juice, containing <first ingredient>, <second ingredient>, <third ingredient>". 
//   Use the forEach method.

// The client wants 6 ingredients in his juice, therefore, invoke the addIngredients function TWICE. Then 
// invoke once the displayJuice function. Finally, invoke the makeJuice function in the global scope. -->



// PART 1
function makeJuice(size) {
function addIngredients(ingredient1, ingredient2, ingredient3) {
  console.log(`The client wants a ${size} juice, containing ${ingredient1}, ${ingredient2}, ${ingredient3}.`);
}
addIngredients("apple", "carrot", "ginger");
}
makeJuice("medium");
// Output: The client wants a medium juice, containing apple, carrot, ginger.


// PART 2
function makeJuice(size) {
const ingredients = [];

function addIngredients(ingredient1, ingredient2, ingredient3) {
  ingredients.push(ingredient1, ingredient2, ingredient3);
}

addIngredients("apple", "carrot", "ginger");
addIngredients("orange", "kale", "celery");

function displayJuice() {
  console.log(`The client wants a ${size} juice, containing ${ingredients.join(', ')}.`);
}

displayJuice();
}

makeJuice("large");
// Output: The client wants a large juice, containing apple, carrot, ginger, orange, kale, celery.
