<!-- In the given code, const taskElement = event.target.closest('.task') 
is used in the deleteTask() function to get the closest ancestor element 
with a class of "task" of the clicked delete button. This ancestor element 
contains the task information to be deleted. The closest() method returns the 
closest ancestor of the current element (i.e., the element that triggered 
the event) that matches the provided selector. -->

<!-- tasks = tasks.filter(t => t.task_id !== taskId) is used to delete the task 
from the tasks array based on its task_id. This line of code is executed in 
the deleteTask() function. The filter() method creates a new array with all 
elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. 
In this case, the function tests if the task_id of the current task is not equal 
to the taskId of the task to be deleted. If the task_id matches, the task is 
removed from the new array. The resulting array is assigned back to the tasks 
variable, effectively removing the deleted task from the array.-->
