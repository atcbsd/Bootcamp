<!-- Planets and Moons Visualization

This project is a simple visualization of the planets in our solar system and their number of moons. The code is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and creates a visual representation of the planets and moons using the data provided in the planets array.

The project will display a visual representation of the planets and their moons. Each planet is represented by a colored circle, and each moon is represented by a smaller circle positioned around its parent planet. The planets and moons are created dynamically using the data provided in the planets array.

First we created an array called planets that contains objects representing each planet in our solar system. Each planet object has two properties: name, which contains the name of the planet as a string, and moons, which contains the number of moons that planet has as an integer.

Then we created a constant called listPlanets that contains a reference to the DOM element with the class listPlanets. This element is where the planet and moon elements will be appended to.

planets.forEach(planet => { ... });

This is a forEach loop that iterates over each planet object in the planets array. Creating a new div element called planetDiv and adding two classes to it: planet, and the name of the planet in lowercase. It then appends the planetDiv element to the listPlanets element.

Then we created a for loop for loop that creates a div element called moonDiv for each moon that the planet has. It adds two classes to the moonDiv: moon and the name of the planet in lowercase. It also positions each moon around its parent planet by setting the left style property of the moonDiv. Finally, it appends each moonDiv element to its parent planetDiv element.

You can customize the appearance of the planets and moons by editing the CSS styles in the <style> tag. To add or remove planets or moons, simply modify the data in the planets array. -->
