    <!-- DAILY CHALLENGE WEEK 9, DAY 5 (Mini Project). DATES 

        Instructions :
Create a function that takes a date object and return string in the following format: YYYYMMDDHHmmSS.

The format should contain a 4 digit year, 2 digit month, 2 digit day, 2 digit hour(00-23), 2 digit minute 
and 2 digit second.
If any of the value has only single digit, you must use zero prefix, so that the result string length is 
always the same.

Examples

formatDate(new Date(2020, 6, 4, 8, 0, 0)) ➞ "20200704080000"

formatDate(new Date(2019, 11, 31, 23, 59, 59)) ➞ "20191231235959"

formatDate(new Date(2020, 6, 4)) ➞ "20200704000000"


Notes
Assume Date year input will always be greater than 1970.

Try not to rely on the default Date.toString() output in your implementation.

Be aware that the Date's month field is zero based (0 is January and 11 is December).
    

SOLUTION:

const formatDate = date => [
    'getFullYear',
    'getMonth',
    'getDate',
    'getHours',
    'getMinutes',
    'getSeconds'
].map((s, i) => `${date[s]() + (i === 1)}`.padStart(2, '0')).join``;

formatDate(new Date(2020, 6, 4, 8, 0, 0))





The given solution implements a function called formatDate. 
This function takes a date object as input and returns a string formatted according to the 
specified pattern: "YYYYMMDDHHmmSS".

Let's break down the solution step by step:

The function formatDate is declared with a parameter named date, which represents the input date object.

Inside the function, an array of method names is defined: ['getFullYear', 'getMonth', 'getDate', 'getHours', 'getMinutes', 'getSeconds']. These methods are available on JavaScript's Date object and are used to retrieve the corresponding values of the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second from the input date.
The map method is called on the array of method names. This iterates over each method name and applies a 
mapping operation.

In the mapping operation, the current method name is passed to the date object using square bracket 
notation to retrieve the corresponding value. The + operator is used to convert the value to a number. 

Additionally, for the month value (index 1), 1 is added to adjust it from zero-based to one-based.

The obtained values are then converted to strings using template literals (backticks) and concatenated with 
the empty string ('') to ensure they are treated as strings.

For each value, the padStart method is called with arguments of 2 (to ensure the string has a length of 2) 
and '0' (the character used for padding) to add leading zeros if necessary. This ensures that each value 
is represented by two digits.

The resulting array of formatted values is joined into a single string using the join method with an 
empty string as the separator.

The final formatted string is returned from the formatDate function.
To test the solution, the provided example is executed:

javascript

formatDate(new Date(2020, 6, 4, 8, 0, 0))
The expected output is "20200704080000". This represents the date "2020-07-04 08:00:00" in the specified 
format.

    <!-- Exercise WEEK 11 DAY 2 : Daily Challenge : SQL Basics

    Create a database for actors:

    CREATE DATABASE actors

    Create a table actors. 
    Add the columns: id, last_name, first_name, birth_date. 

    (The id has to be auto_incremented) 

    SOLUTION:

    Open pgadmin you can create a server or create a new database. 
    Hover to databases and tehn go to schemas / tables
    selecting tables select query tool and start creating.

CREATE TABLE actors (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        first_name VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
        last_name VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
        birth_date DATE NOT NULL,
        num_oscars VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL
)

Insert
You have to reproduce exactly this table.

INSERT INTO actors (first_name, last_name, birth_date, num_oscars) VALUES 
('Johnny', 'Depp','1963-06-09', 0),  
(Meryl', 'Streep', '1949-06-22', 3), 
(Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', '1974-11-11', 1), 
('Scarlett', 'Johansson', '1984-11-22', 0), 
('Denzel', 'Washington', '1954-12-28', 2)


INSERT INTO actors VALUES ('William', 'Shatner', '1955-04-25', 0), ('Dolly', 'Parton', '1959-11-29', 0)

Fetch all the data of the table
SELECT * FROM actors


Daily Challenge : SQL Basics
Using the table actors from the lesson,

Count how many actors are in the table
Try to add a new actor, with some blank fields. What happens ?

SELECT count(*) FROM actors

INSERT INTO actors(f_name, l_name, age, num_oscars) VALUES (NULL)





🌟 Exercise 2 : Dvdrental Database (WEEK 11 DAY 4) 
Instructions
Setup
We will install a new sample database on our PostgreSQL servers.
Download this sample database file

There is a single file called dvdrental.tar inside the zip. Extract it to your local directory.
Tip : If you are using Mac, after extracting the zip file you will get a folder called dvdrental

We will use the newly installed dvdrental database.

Download DVD Rental Sample Database and unzip.
Create an empty database "dvdrental"
click right click on dvdrental hierarchy and select restore then add a new folder with the restore.sql
to do this on format change from custom or tar to Directory, then instead of selecting the file
we are selecting, select dvdrental folder as a whole.



1.) In the dvdrental database write a query to select all the columns from the “customer” table.

SELECT * FROM customer

SELECT * FROM address


2.) Write a query to display the names (first_name, last_name) using an alias named “full_name”.

SELECT CONCAT(first_name, last_name) AS full_name FROM customer

SELECT CONCAT_WS(' ', first_name, last_name) AS full_name FROM customer

3.) Lets get all the dates that accounts were created. Write a query to select all the create_date from 
the “customer” table (there should be no duplicates).

SELECT DISTINCT create_date FROM customer

4.) Write a query to get all the customer details from the customer table, it should be displayed in 
descending order by their first name.

SELECT * FROM customer ORDER BY first_name DESC

5.) Write a query to get the film ID, title, description, year of release and rental rate in ascending order 
according to their rental rate.

SELECT film_id, title, description, release_year, rental_rate FROM film ORDER BY rental_rate ASC

6.) Write a query to get the address, and the phone number of all customers living in the Texas district, 
these details can be found in the “address” table.

SELECT * FROM customer INNER JOIN address ON customer.addres_id=address.address_id WHERE (district='Texas')

SELECT address, phone FROM customer INNER JOIN address ON customer.addres_id=address.address_id WHERE (district='Texas')


This SQL statement is performing an INNER JOIN operation between the "customer" and "address" tables. 
It combines rows from both tables based on a common column, which is "address_id" in both tables.
Here's a breakdown of the statement:

"SELECT address, phone": This specifies that we want to select the "address" and "phone" columns from the 
resulting joined table.
"FROM customer": This indicates that the "customer" table is the primary table from which we are selecting 
data.
"INNER JOIN address": This defines the INNER JOIN operation and specifies the "address" table as the 
second table involved in the join.
"ON customer.addres_id = address.address_id": This is the join condition, which states that the join 
should be performed where the "address_id" column in the "customer" table is equal to the "address_id" 
column in the "address" table.
"WHERE (district='Texas')": This is a condition that filters the result set based on the value in the 
"district" column from the "address" table. It only includes rows where the district is "Texas".
By executing this SQL statement, the database will return a result set that includes the "address" and 
"phone" columns from the joined "customer" and "address" tables. The result set will only include 
rows where the district is "Texas". This query allows you to retrieve the address and phone number 
of customers located in the "Texas" district.


7.) Write a query to retrieve all movie details where the movie id is either 15 or 150.

SELECT * FROM film WHERE (film_id=150 OR film_id=15)

8.) Write a query which should check if your favorite movie exists in the database. Have your query get 
the film ID, title, description, length and the rental rate, these details can be found in the “film” table.

SELECT film_id, title, description, length, rental_rate FROM film WHERE (title='Breaking Home')

9.) No luck finding your movie? Maybe you made a mistake spelling the name. Write a query to get the film 
ID, title, description, length and the rental rate of all the movies starting with the two first letters 
of your favorite movie.

SELECT film_id, title, description, length rental_rate FROM film WHERE (title='Breaking Home')

SELECT film_id, title, description, length rental_rate FROM film WHERE (title LIKE 'Br%')

10.) Write a query which will find the 10 cheapest movies.

SELECT * FROM film ORDER BY rental_rate ASC LIMIT 10

11.) Not satisfied with the results. Write a query which will find the next 10 cheapest movies.
Bonus: Try to not use LIMIT.
    
SELECT * FROM film ORDER BY rental_rate ASC FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY OFFSET 10

Alternatively we could solve this by:

SELECT * FROM film ORDER BY rental_rate ASC OFFSET 10 LIMIT 10

12.) Write a query which will join the data in the customer table and the payment table. You want to get 
the first name and last name from the curstomer table, as well as the amount and the date of every 
payment made by a customer, ordered by their id (from 1 to…).

SELECT * FROM customer INNER JOIN payment ON payment.customer_id=customer.customer_id ORDER BY payment.customer_id

Change * to:

payment.customer_id, first_name, last_name, amount, payment_date



The given SQL statement is performing an INNER JOIN operation between two tables: "customer" and "payment." 
It combines rows from both tables based on a common column, which is "customer_id" in both the "customer" 
and "payment" tables.
Here's a breakdown of the statement:

"SELECT *": This specifies that we want to select all columns from the resulting joined table.
"FROM customer": This indicates that the "customer" table is the primary table from which we are selecting 
data.
"INNER JOIN payment": This defines the INNER JOIN operation and specifies the "payment" table as the second 
table involved in the join.
"ON payment.customer_id=customer.customer_id": This is the join condition, which states that the join 
should be performed where the "customer_id" column in the "payment" table is equal to the 
"customer_id" column in the "customer" table.
"ORDER BY payment.customer_id": This clause orders the result set in ascending order based on the 
"customer_id" column in the "payment" table.
By executing this SQL statement, the database will return a result set that includes all columns 
from both the "customer" and "payment" tables, where the join condition is satisfied. The result set 
will be ordered based on the "customer_id" column from the "payment" table. This means that the rows 
will be sorted in ascending order based on the customer ID in the "payment" table.



13.) You need to check your inventory. Write a query to get all the movies which are not in inventory.

SELECT * FROM film LEFT JOIN inventory ON film.film_id=inventory.film_id WHERE inventory_id IS NULL

14.) Write a query to find which city is in which country.

SELECT * FROM city INNER JOIN country on city.country_id=country.country_id

15.) Bonus You want to be able to see how your sellers have been doing? Write a query to get the customer’s 
id, names (first and last), the amount and the date of payment ordered by the id of the staff member who 
sold them the dvd.

SELECT * FROM payment INNER JOIN customer ON customer.customer_id=payment.customer_id ORDER BY staff_id ASC


Change * to: customer.customer_id, first_name, last_name, amount, payment_date, staff_id



Extra:
SELECT COUNT (*) FROM payment INNER JOIN customer ON customer.customer_id=payment.customer_id

ID  Name
5   Pawan
6   Sharlee
7   Krish
NULL    Avtaar


Table2 – SecondTab
ID
5
NULL


Questions
Q1. What will be the OUTPUT of the following statement?

    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id IS NULL )


Q2. What will be the OUTPUT of the following statement?

Q4. What will be the OUTPUT of the following statement?

    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id IS NOT NULL )




SOLUTIONS:

Go to pgadmin and create a database called quiz.
Open query tool in quiz.

CREATE TABLE FirstTab (
    id integer,
    name VARCHAR (10)
);

INSERT INTO FirstTab VALUES
(5, 'Pawan'),
(6, 'Sharlee'),
(7, 'Krish'),
(NULL, 'Avtaar');

SELECT * FROM FirstTab




Secondly add;

CREATE TABLE SecondTab (
    id integer
);

INSERT INTO SecondTab VALUES
(5),
(NULL);

SELECT * FROM SecondTab




Q1: HOW MANY ENTRIES IN TAB1 THAT ARE NOT NULL?


SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id IS NULL )


RESULT: 0 (NULL is something it is a marker or placeholder. 
NULL is not technically VALUE it is the absence of a VALUE)
It is not true or false it is just null so we cant compare.


SQL statement is performing a count operation on the "FirstTab" table. It checks for the number of rows 
that satisfy a specific condition.

Here's a breakdown of the statement:

"SELECT COUNT(*)": This specifies that we want to count the number of rows that meet the defined criteria.
"FROM FirstTab AS ft": This indicates that we are selecting data from the "FirstTab" table and assigning 
it the alias "ft" for easier reference in the query.
"WHERE ft.id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id IS NULL)": This is the condition that determines 
which rows will be included in the count. It specifies that we want to exclude rows where the "id" value 
in the "FirstTab" table is present in the result of the subquery.
The subquery "SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id IS NULL" retrieves the "id" values from the "SecondTab" 
table where the "id" is NULL.
By executing this SQL statement, the database will return the count of rows in the "FirstTab" table that 
have an "id" value not present in the "SecondTab" table where the "id" is NULL. In other words, it counts 
the number of rows in "FirstTab" that do not have a corresponding NULL "id" value in the "SecondTab" table.




Q2: Compare values that are not 5.

SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id = 5 )


RESULT: 2
Since we cant compare the null it is simply going to be 2.

"SELECT COUNT(*)": This specifies that we want to count the number of rows that meet the defined criteria.
"FROM FirstTab AS ft": This indicates that we are selecting data from the "FirstTab" table and assigning it

"WHERE ft.id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id = 5)": This is the condition that determines which 
rows will be included in the count. It specifies that we want to exclude rows where the "id" value in 
the "FirstTab" table is present in the result of the subquery.
The subquery "SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id = 5" retrieves the "id" values from the "SecondTab" table 
where the "id" is equal to 5.
By executing this SQL statement, the database will return the count of rows in the "FirstTab" table that 
have an "id" value not equal to 5 in the "SecondTab" table. In other words, it counts the number of rows 
in "FirstTab" that do not have a corresponding "id" value of 5 in the "SecondTab" table.



Q3: Compare first tab to second tab.

    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab )


RESULT: 0 (Cant compare something to NULL)


SQL statement is performing a count operation on the "FirstTab" table. It checks for the number of rows 
that satisfy a specific condition.

Here's a breakdown of the statement:

"SELECT COUNT(*)": This specifies that we want to count the number of rows that meet the defined criteria.
"FROM FirstTab AS ft": This indicates that we are selecting data from the "FirstTab" table and assigning 
it the alias "ft" for easier reference in the query.
"WHERE ft.id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM SecondTab)": This is the condition that determines which rows will 
be included in the count. It specifies that we want to exclude rows where the "id" value in the "FirstTab" 
table is present in the result of the subquery.
The subquery "SELECT id FROM SecondTab" retrieves the "id" values from the "SecondTab" table.
By executing this SQL statement, the database will return the count of rows in the "FirstTab" table that 
have an "id" value not present in the "SecondTab" table. In other words, it counts the number of rows in 
"FirstTab" that do not have a corresponding "id" value in the "SecondTab" table.



Q4: We want all the ids that are not going to be equal to 5. 

SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id IS NOT NULL )


RESULT: 2 (Once again cant compare something to NULL)


SQL statement is performing a count operation on the "FirstTab" table. It checks for the number of rows that satisfy a specific condition.

Here's a breakdown of the statement:

"SELECT COUNT(*)": This specifies that we want to count the number of rows that meet the defined criteria.
