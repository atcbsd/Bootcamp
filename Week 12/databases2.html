<!--DAY 1 Green Exercise (POSTGRES SQL JOINS)
Create another table, called countries, with two fields : country_id and coutry_name. 
It has no foreign key. It's a table to test the PostgreSQL Joins.

Use INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN to join the table countries 
with the table actors, depending on the comparaison of their primary key
Look at the results, and analyse them to understand the difference between the types of 
PostgreSQL Joins 


-- Create the "countries" table

CREATE TABLE countries (
  country_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  country_name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Create the "actors" table

CREATE TABLE actors (
  actor_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  actor_name VARCHAR(100),
  country_id INT
);


-- Insert actors into the "actors" table

INSERT INTO actors (actor_name, country_id)
VALUES
  ('Tom Hanks', 1),
  ('Brad Pitt', 2),
  ('Natalie Portman', 3);

-- Insert countries into the "countries" table

INSERT INTO countries (country_name)
VALUES
  ('USA'),
  ('France'),
  ('Israel');



-- Perform the INNER JOIN

SELECT *
FROM countries
INNER JOIN actors ON countries.country_id = actors.country_id;

-- Perform the LEFT OUTER JOIN

SELECT *
FROM countries
LEFT OUTER JOIN actors ON countries.country_id = actors.country_id;

-- Perform the RIGHT OUTER JOIN

SELECT *
FROM countries
RIGHT OUTER JOIN actors ON countries.country_id = actors.country_id;

-- Perform the FULL OUTER JOIN

SELECT *
FROM countries
FULL OUTER JOIN actors ON countries.country_id = actors.country_id;


In the above example, we first create the "countries" table with two fields: "country_id" and "country_name". 
Then, we create the "actors" table with fields "actor_id", "actor_name", and "country_id" 
(assuming it already exists).

Next, we perform the different types of joins:

INNER JOIN: This join returns only the rows where the "country_id" exists in both the "countries" 
and "actors" tables.
LEFT OUTER JOIN: This join returns all the rows from the "countries" table and the matching rows from 
the "actors" table based on the "country_id". If there is no match, NULL values are returned for 
the "actors" table columns.
RIGHT OUTER JOIN: This join returns all the rows from the "actors" table and the matching rows from 
the "countries" table based on the "country_id". If there is no match, NULL values are returned for 
the "countries" table columns.
FULL OUTER JOIN: This join returns all the rows from both the "countries" and "actors" tables. If there 
is no match, NULL values are returned for the respective table's columns.
By analyzing the results of these joins, you can observe the differences between them based on the 
matching and non-matching rows in the two tables.

Instructions
Get a list of all film languages.

SELECT * from language;

REDO (This is wrong)
Get a list of all films joined with their languages – select the following details : film title, 
description, and language name. Try your query with different joins:
Get all films, even if they don’t have languages.
Get all languages, even if there are no films in those languages.

SELECT * from film LEFT JOIN language ON film. language_id=language. language_id;

SELECT film.title, film.description, language.name from film 
LEFT JOIN language ON film.language_id=language.language_id;

SELECT film.title, film.description, language.name from film 
INNER JOIN language ON film.language_id=language.language_id;

SELECT film.title, film.description, language.name from film 
RIGHT JOIN language ON film.language_id=language.language_id;




Create a new table called new_film with the following columns : id, name. Add some new films to the table.

CREATE TABLE new_film(
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR (100)
)


INSERT INTO new film (name)
VALUES ('Titanic'), ('The Hobbit'), ('Little Miss Sunshine')


SELECT * FROM new_film


Create a new table called customer_review, which will contain film reviews that customers will make.
Think about the DELETE constraint: if a film is deleted, its review should be automatically deleted.
It should have the following columns:
review_id – a primary key, non null, auto-increment.
film_id – references the new_film table. The film that is being reviewed.
language_id – references the language table. What language the review is in.
title – the title of the review.
score – the rating of the review (1-10).
review_text – the text of the review. No limit on the length.
last_update – when the review was last updated.


CREATE TABLE customer_reviews (
review_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
film_id INT NOT NULL,
language_id INT NOT NULL,
title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
score INT NOT NULL,
review_text TEXT,
last_update TIMESTAMP DEFAULT current_timestamp,

CONSTRAINT fk_language_id FOREIGN KEY (language_id) REFERENCES language(language_id), 
CONSTRAINT fk_film_id FOREIGN KEY (film_id) REFERENCES new_film (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
CONSTRAINT score_value CHECK (score > 0 AND score <= 10)
)

after ON DELETE CASCADE we could add ON UPDATE CASCADE


CONSTRAINT fk_language_id FOREIGN KEY (language_id) REFERENCES language(language_id): 
This constraint establishes a foreign key relationship on the language_id column, referencing the 
language table's language_id column. It ensures that the language_id values in the customer_reviews 
table must exist in the language table.

CONSTRAINT fk_film_id FOREIGN KEY film_id REFERENCES new_film (id) ON DELETE CASCADE: This constraint 
establishes a foreign key relationship on the film_id column, referencing the id column of the new_film 
table. The ON DELETE CASCADE specifies that if a film is deleted from the new_film table, all corresponding 
rows in the customer_reviews table will also be deleted.

CONSTRAINT score_value CHECK (score > 0 AND score <= 10): This constraint ensures that the score value 
in the customer_reviews table must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10.



Add 2 movie reviews. Make sure you link them to valid objects in the other tables.


INSERT INTO customer_reviews (film_id, language_id, title, score, review_text) VALUES
(1, 1, 'Great movie', 10, 'The firs tmovie I saw when I was a kid'),
(3,1, 'Not bad', 9, 'A bit long but great story') RETURNING *


Delete a film that has a review from the new_film table, what happens to the customer_review table?

SELECT * FROM new_film

DELETE FROM new_film WHERE (name='Titanic') RETURNING *






🌟 Exercise 2 : DVD Rental
Instructions
Use UPDATE to change the language of some films. Make sure that you use valid languages.


UPDATE film SET language_id = '2' WHERE film_id < 10;
    UPDATE film SET language_id = '3' WHERE film_id = 100;
    UPDATE film SET language_id = '4' WHERE film_id > 104 AND film_id < 115;



Which foreign keys (references) are defined for the customer table? How does this affect the way in which 
we INSERT into the customer table?

store_id and address_id are connected as references.
The numbers are picked according to the reference ID's,
so can be in random order depoending on the input


We created a new table called customer_review. Drop this table. Is this an easy step, or does it need 
extra checking?

DROP TABLE customer_reviews;
No extra step, because the dependecies are on a foreign key


Find out how many rentals are still outstanding (ie. have not been returned to the store yet).

select COUNT(*) from rental WHERE return_date IS NULL;


Find the 30 most expensive movies which are outstanding (ie. have not been returned to the store yet)

Your friend is at the store, and decides to rent a movie. He knows he wants to see 4 movies, but he can’t 
remember their names. Can you help him find which movies he wants to rent?

The 1st film : The film is about a sumo wrestler, and one of the actors is Penelope Monroe.


SELECT title FROM film
JOIN film_actor ON film_actor.film_id=film.film_id
WHERE fulltext @@ to_tsquery('sumo')

Create a new table called customer_review, which will contain film reviews that customers will make.
Think about the DELETE constraint: if a film is deleted, its review should be automatically deleted.
It should have the following columns:
review_id – a primary key, non null, auto-increment.
film_id – references the new_film table. The film that is being reviewed.
language_id – references the language table. What language the review is in.
title – the title of the review.
score – the rating of the review (1-10).
review_text – the text of the review. No limit on the length.
last_update – when the review was last updated.


Let's break down the components of this statement:


CREATE TABLE customer_reviews (
This line initiates the creation of a table named "customer_reviews."


review_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
This line creates a column named "review_id" that serves as the primary key of the table. 
The "SERIAL" data type is used to automatically generate a unique identifier for each row. 
"PRIMARY KEY" indicates that this column will uniquely identify each row in the table, and "NOT NULL" 
specifies that the column must have a value for each row.


film_id INT NOT NULL,
This line creates a column named "film_id" with the integer data type. It is used to store the ID of 
the film related to the review. "NOT NULL" ensures that a value is required for each row.


language_id INT NOT NULL,
This line creates a column named "language_id" with the integer data type. It is used to store the ID of 
the language in which the review is written. "NOT NULL" ensures that a value is required for each row.


title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
This line creates a column named "title" with the VARCHAR data type, which is used to store text data of 
variable length. The maximum length for this column is set to 100 characters. "NOT NULL" specifies that a 
value is required for each row.


score INT NOT NULL,
This line creates a column named "score" with the integer data type. It is used to store the rating 
score given in the review. "NOT NULL" ensures that a value is required for each row.


review_text TEXT,
This line creates a column named "review_text" with the TEXT data type, which is used to store longer 
text data. It is used to store the actual content of the review.


last_update TIMESTAMP DEFAULT current_timestamp,
This line creates a column named "last_update" with the TIMESTAMP data type. It is used to store the 
timestamp of when the review was last updated. The "DEFAULT current_timestamp" specifies that if no value 
is provided, the current timestamp will be automatically inserted.


CONSTRAINT fk_language_id FOREIGN KEY (language_id) REFERENCES language(language_id), 
This line creates a foreign key constraint named "fk_language_id" that references the "language" table and 
its "language_id" column. It ensures that the "language_id" column in the "customer_reviews" table 
references a valid entry in the "language" table.


CONSTRAINT fk_film_id FOREIGN KEY film_id REFERENCES new_film (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
This line creates a foreign key constraint named "fk_film_id" that references the "new_film" table and 
its "id" column. It ensures that the "film_id" column in the "customer_reviews" table references a 
valid entry in the "new_film" table. The "ON DELETE CASCADE" specifies that if a film is deleted from 
the "new_film" table, the corresponding reviews in the "customer_reviews" table will also be deleted.


CONSTRAINT score_value CHECK (score > 0 AND score <= 10)
This line creates a constraint named "score_value" that checks the values entered in the "score" column. 
It ensures that the score value is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10.

Overall, this SQL statement creates a table named "customer_reviews" with columns 
for review ID, film ID, language










DAILY CHALLENGE WEEK 12 DAY 2
Instructions
You are going to practice tables relationships

Part I

Create 2 tables : Customer and Customer profile. They have a One to One relationship.

A customer can have only one profile, and a profile belongs to only one customer
The Customer table should have the columns : id, first_name, last_name NOT NULL
The Customer profile table should have the columns : id, isLoggedIn DEFAULT false (a Boolean), customer_id 
(a reference to the Customer table)

Insert those customers

John, Doe
Jerome, Lalu
Lea, Rive

Insert those customer profiles, use subqueries

John is loggedIn
Jerome is not logged in

Use the relevant types of Joins to display:

The first_name of the LoggedIn customers
All the customers first_name and isLoggedIn columns - even the customers those who don’t have a profile.
The number of customers that are not LoggedIn


Part II:

Create a table named Book, with the columns : book_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, title NOT NULL, author NOT NULL

Insert those books :
Alice In Wonderland, Lewis Carroll
Harry Potter, J.K Rowling
To kill a mockingbird, Harper Lee

Create a table named Student, with the columns : student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name NOT NULL UNIQUE, 
age. Make sure that the age is never bigger than 15 (Find an SQL method);

Insert those students:
John, 12
Lera, 11
Patrick, 10
Bob, 14

Create a table named Library, with the columns :
book_fk_id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
student_id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
borrowed_date
This table, is a junction table for a Many to Many relationship with the Book and Student tables : 
A student can borrow many books, and a book can be borrowed by many children
book_fk_id is a Foreign Key representing the column book_id from the Book table
student_fk_id is a Foreign Key representing the column student_id from the Student table
The pair of Foreign Keys is the Primary Key of the Junction Table

Add 4 records in the junction table, use subqueries.
the student named John, borrowed the book Alice In Wonderland on the 15/02/2022
the student named Bob, borrowed the book To kill a mockingbird on the 03/03/2021
the student named Lera, borrowed the book Alice In Wonderland on the 23/05/2021
the student named Bob, borrowed the book Harry Potter the on 12/08/2021
